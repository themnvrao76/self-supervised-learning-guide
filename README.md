# Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) - A Step-by-Step Guide üìñ

## Overview üéØ
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a machine learning paradigm where models learn from **unlabeled data** by generating their own supervision through pretext tasks. SSL has become a powerful technique in both **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, dramatically reducing the reliance on human-annotated labels.

This guide provides a structured **learning roadmap** along with key research papers and additional resources to help you master SSL from the ground up.
